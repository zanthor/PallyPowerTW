### How to install: Download the zip file and rename to PallyPowerTW or use Turtle WOW Launcher
### Hunter pets and Warrors share same class so if you use Greater blessings it will affect both Warriors and Pets ( not a bug )
### Currently "[Patch FR] Turtle WoW en français + Pack de voix française corrigé pour VoiceOver" is not supported. PPTW does not work correctly when this mod is installed
